    info: "You stumble into a basement shop filled with all sorts of things, all weirder than the last. Behind the counter, a tall, slim, almost arachnid-like figure smiles at you and introduces himself as “Fiminor”. This is his shop of assorted goods, “Fiminor’s Finery”.

The cave does not seem inviting, but the alternative is to delve into the forest and be lost, so you proceed in.

Its head is from some kind of an insect with a gaping maw and even though it doesn’t have physical eyes, you can feel its stare penetrating your soul. All the villagers prostrate themselves, seeing you, the creature sets its hungry eyes upon you and starts to make its way towards you, crushing some of the villagers.

Your adventure is complete, the town is saved and with the villagers’ eyes no longer glowing, they regard you as a hero, stopping the prophecy of the moon. You can finally rest, hero.",
