          Niko Hienonen is a composer/producer, primarily known for orchestral
          arrangements. With his band, "KARU", co-founded with Kalle Pöyskö,
          Hienonen is the vocalist, producer, composer, orchestral arranger as
          well as mix and mastering engineer. Hienonen also offers these
          services to other bands, primarily metal acts.

          Outside of bands, Hienonen also composes OST's for games. He is
          currently working on two different game projects, hopefully publishing
          something about them soon.

          Hienonen is known for his highly visual composition style, seeking to
          transport the listener to the emotional landscape of the music. His
          scores are usually larger than life, seeking to either tear at the
          listener's soul with delicate emotional work, or blast the listener
          from their chair with raging braams and percussion.

          The just released "EXISTENTIAL HORROR" is a testament to Hienonen's
          ability to compose horror and instill true emotions of fear and unease
          upon the listener.
